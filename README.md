# That directory contains the program that differentates the function

# How to build

```terminal
  $ https://github.com/IraIvanov/Differentiator-Reworked   
  $ cd Differentiator-Reworked
  $ make    
  $ ./program     
  ```
   After launching program from terminal using ./differentiator you should input function using keyboard, then you get the .pdf file, with your inputed function and recieved differential.
   
  This project uses data containers such stack and binary tree. Libraries to interact with them were written by myself.
  
  Also to read function from terminal differentiator uses recursive descent algorithm.
